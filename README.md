# Discrete_OpAmp
A Single Ended Operational Amplifier mainly made with bipolar technology and a NMOS differential pair, two amplification stages and a Class AB output stage. Entirely designed with discrete components, soldered onto a self-made, 2 layers PCB.

Final results, in lab tests:

- +-5V dual power supply, 10 mA current absorption, buffer configuration.
- GBWP > 3Mhz.
- HD2 = 40dB (second harmonic distortion).
- Slew Rate = 1.5V/us.
- Offset = 50mV.
